# Overview

I have been a professional developer since 1998. I love sitting at my computer pushing characters around and having it produce something I just asked it to do. Whether it be a simple batch script, programming a desktop/mobile application within an IDE, or creating a backend web service.

My current passion has been being as much of an Android expert as I can be. I've built many applications from the ground up and each one gets better. As the platform gets better, I'm right there with it using new technologies and improving on issues I've faced in the past.

Over the years I've been asked to architect solutions, design new features, fix old code, and have been asked to step into someone else's code to continue their work. I have also been the lead localization developer for a large code base that has shipped in over 13 languages and I've managed small teams of developers. I've always taken on these challenges fully and feel I can contribute in just about any environment. Successfully shifting gears to mobile development in the last few years has only proven that to myself even more.

# Experience

## Principal Application Developer, Noble Applications 
######Nov. 2013 to May 2014 

Noble Applications creates custom mobile applications for businesses. Specializing in iOS and Android platforms, developing only 100% native-code applications. As most mobile applications are rarely just a stand alone application on a users device, Noble Applications also provides back end services and web development for client applications.

As the Principal Application Developer, my role was to understand the mobile application marketplace, their trends, and all other aspects of mobile ecosystems to deliver the best possible mobile applications for customers. My focus was primarily within the Android ecosystem where I provided guidance to customers on not only platform limitations, but platform possibilities. 

I was responsible for the release of all of Noble's Android applications from start to end. Those designs are oriented to provide a polished, full user experience for customers.

I was also responsible for not only interfacing Android applications with the customers existing infrastructure, but also responsible for providing new infrastructure for new applications. We used several technologies for this depending on the needs of the customer. These included:

+ Interfacing with Google App Engine.
+ Creating SQL server databases.
+ Creating Tomcat servlets to for RESTFUL CRUD operations with SQL. 
+ Storing and retrieving media from Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3. 

###The following applications are samples of my work at Noble Applications that are publicly visible:

**Broaster Store Locator, Broaster Company** [(Google Play Store Link)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.broaster.locator)

The Broaster Store Locator uses the devices gps position and the Google Maps API to query and show nearby locations to purchase Broaster Chicken. Integrated with Maps for Directions, phone for calling location, and clients Twitter and Facebook presence.

**Feedscan, Rock River Labs** [(Google Play Store Link)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockriver.feedscan)

The Feedscan application was built to replace the clients mobile web page solution. The app integrates a barcode scanner and interfaces with clients infrastructure to submit samples for analysis. The users are typically in rural areas with limited data access. It recognizes the loss of connectivity and adapts accordingly. Submitting samples once the user is re-connected.

**OrdrIT, OrdrIT LLC** [(Google Play Store Link)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innovativedeliverysystems.ordrit)

The OrdrIT application was developed for stadiums to allow customers to order food and beverages from their seats. It replaced the customers mobile web page and interfaces with a backend infrastructure created by Noble Applications

## Senior Application Developer, StudyBlue.com
######Oct. 2011 to Sept. 2013

[StudyBlue in the Android Play Store]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studyblue)

StudyBlue provides services to students in the digital age to help them study. From flipping flashcards, to sharing notes, from middle school to med school. With over 5 million users (and growing) who make around a million cards per week the problems to tackle were very large scale and fun.

I was brought in to work on the mobile development team and worked on both the Android and iOS applications and maintained the REST API for accessing user content on mobile applications. 

I was the dev lead for the Android application where I took the app from being a carbon copy of the original iOS application to an application that follow's Google's Android guidelines. The result of this rewrite is an application that used common UI components for navigation and actions, is much more stable, runs faster, has a better user rating, and looks more modern.

**Mobile Contributions:**

+ Implemented many features for the Android application such as: In-app billing, using location services to find schools near you, and improved user content management. 
+ Greatly improved speed and reliability of the application. 
+ Greatly reduced memory usage, and found and fixed many bugs and anti-pattern problems. 
+ The apps rely on a RESTFUL web service to access and update user content which I maintained and added to as needed. 
+ Contributed to the development of the universal iOS application for iPhone and iPad. 
+ Added and re-implemented many features for the iPad version that existed on iPhone or Android.

##Software Developer, Quest Software (Now a part of Dell inc.) 
######May 2010 to Oct. 2011

Quest was a Multi-National company with a wide variety of products. I worked in the Madison R&D group to help to maintain and enhance the email coexistence product for Exchange, GroupWise and Lotus. 

The Quest development process used the TFS Agile template. All aspects of Agile development were used to estimate time, scale and delivery dates. While at Quest I learned to fully appreciate the advantage Agile can have over traditional development processes.

**Projects:**

- Maintained and improved the email connector product. 
- Co-designed and implemented a new product for consolidating non-Windows infrastructure such as LDAP into Active Directory. I developed the user interface for setting up connections and the back end windows service to synchronize the data.
- Designed and Implemented configuration methods for a new Free/Busy product. The product configuration was deeply involved and complicated. I was able to create configuration end points to use the existing configuration application and greatly streamline and improve the configuration of the product.
- Developed C# winform controls and forms to enhance GUI in user configuration tools.
- Created PowerShell PowerPack for PowerGUI to provide end users flexibility in creating and managing settings.
- Researched and implemented an encryption solution to encrypt passwords to match 3rd party libraries. This implementation kept us from having to use an expensive library and from having to go through a lengthy approval process.

##Software Design Engineer, Sonic Foundry, Inc.

####Software Design Engineer, Sony Media Software
######June 2003 to April 2006

**Projects:**

 - Worked on the open/save file format plug-ins for their desktop applications. These components were COM based modules and often encapsulated third-party SDK's and codecs to open and save various audio and video file formats. I was responsible for implementing UI to configure plug-in settings in applications and maintaining existing plug-ins.
 - Worked on the first C# application released from their company, Disc2Phone, a Windows forms application to create and transfer mp3â€™s to the first Walkman branded mobile phone. I developed the wrappers for un-managed code using P/Invoke methods, implemented a CD information lookup using 3rd party libraries, and created a localized installer. The product was developed on a short time line and was well received for providing a valuable customer service.
 - Researched and designed a playback and transcode engine for non-shipping C# based product to support existing DRM format. The project involved communicating with several Sony divisions to implement existing technology and providing a working prototype.
 - As the resident localization expert I spent many years addressing localization and globalization related issues as they arose. This required me to contribute significantly to the overall build scheme and code tree maintenance.

##Software Design Engineer - Localization Lead, Sonic Foudry, Inc.
######June 1998 to June 2003

**Projects:**

 - As the localization lead my small team and I had the task of ensuring that the entire code base (Win32/C++) was multi-byte and Unicode compatible, that all UI code was compatible across locales/cultures, and that applications were locale/culture aware. We shipped over 10 products in 13 different languages.
 - Designed and developed a framework that minimally impacted the existing code base but was able to enable applications to run in additional languages. 
 - Created a framework that allowed our team to prepare application resources and create build kits for translation vendors. This framework shortened the localization time by streamlining the process to allow updates from vendors to be integrated easily.
 - Prior to taking on localization, I was involved with many projects including creating product installers and modifying existing products to expose different features based on the purchased product level.
